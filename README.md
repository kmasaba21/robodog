# robodog

Robodog is a ROS package which implements a leader-follower problem, where the leader is a human whereas a follower is a robot.
 
The goal is to detect the human's strides using the robot's LIDAR scan readings.

This package enables the robot to localize itself, handle obstacle avoidance and follow a human being in the environment.

We are assume that there is only one human in the environment, and the environment is flat.
